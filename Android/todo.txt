Things left to do in the Android project, in no particular order

Essence:

+++ Override the back button, instead of the custom button.
+++ Add a menu with 'Exit' (because Back means something else)
+++ Fix the game behavior when 'try again' is clicked.
+++ Add a 'new game' to the menu.
+++ Invoke 'new game' by shaking.
+++ Make the buzzer really buzz


UI:

+++ Fix the location of buttons when Back is clicked
+++ Change button width to fit entire content
+++ Change 4 button table to a 4 button row with bigger fonts
+++ Add a frame to scratch-pad
+++ Create landscape layout
+++ Add a slightly paperish background of a Machberet Heshbon
+++ Make the Check Result page a lot nicer
+++ Fix RTL looking problems in check answers
+++ Create a decent launch icon

Future additions:

- Change random number generator - too many repeated numbers
- Let the game calculate the correct result itself (use web service first)
- Add an easier mode, where the intermediate results are displayed
